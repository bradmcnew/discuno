## 🔧 Deployment Checklist

### 1. Environment Configuration ✅

The following environment variables are already configured:

```bash
✅ STRIPE_SECRET_KEY
✅ STRIPE_WEBHOOK_SECRET
✅ CRON_SECRET
✅ SENDGRID_API_KEY
```

### 2. Stripe Dashboard Configuration

**A. Webhook Setup** (Required)

1. Go to [Stripe Dashboard → Webhooks](https://dashboard.stripe.com/webhooks)
2. Click "Add endpoint"
3. URL: `https://yourdomain.com/api/webhooks/stripe`
4. Events to select:
   - ✅ `checkout.session.completed`
   - ✅ `payment_intent.succeeded`
   - ✅ `transfer.created`
   - ✅ `account.updated`
5. Copy webhook secret to `STRIPE_WEBHOOK_SECRET` env var

**B. Manual Payouts** (Already Configured)

- Payment flow is configured for manual payouts
- Funds will be held on platform account
- Transfers occur via cron job after 72-hour period

### 3. Cron Job Setup

**Option A: Vercel Cron (Recommended)**
Add to `vercel.json`:

```json
{
  "crons": [
    {
      "path": "/api/cron/transfer-funds",
      "schedule": "0 * * * *"
    }
  ]
}
```

**Option B: External Cron Service**
Set up hourly cron job:

```bash
curl -X GET "https://yourdomain.com/api/cron/transfer-funds" \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer $CRON_SECRET"
```

### 4. Testing the Implementation

**Test Checkout Flow:**

```bash
# 1. Create a booking with payment
# 2. Verify webhook processing
# 3. Check booking creation in Cal.com
# 4. Confirm email notifications
```

**Test Cron Job:**

```bash
# Test the transfer endpoint
curl -X GET "http://localhost:3000/api/cron/transfer-funds" \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer your-cron-secret"
```

**Verify Database:**

- Check `payments` table for proper status tracking
- Verify `disputePeriodEnds` timestamps
- Confirm booking records are created

## 📊 Monitoring Setup

### Key Metrics to Track

- ✅ Payment success rate
- ✅ Transfer success rate
- ✅ Webhook delivery success
- ✅ Email notification delivery
- ✅ Cron job execution status

### Log Monitoring

Monitor these log patterns:

```
✅ "Transfer cron job started"
✅ "Transfer successful for payment"
✅ "Checkout session completed"
✅ "Booking confirmation email sent"
❌ "ADMIN ALERT: Transfer failed"
❌ "Webhook signature verification failed"
```

## 🔐 Security Considerations

### ✅ Implemented Security Features

- Stripe webhook signature verification
- CRON_SECRET authentication for transfer endpoint
